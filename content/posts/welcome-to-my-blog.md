## Hello World! 🚀

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to finally have a space where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings from my journey as an Independent UI5/ABAP Developer.

### What to Expect

On this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **UI5 Development** - Tips, tricks, and best practices for building modern SAP Fiori applications
- **ABAP Programming** - Backend development insights and patterns
- **Open Source** - Updates on my open source projects and contributions
- **SAP Ecosystem** - General thoughts about the SAP development landscape
- **Developer Tools** - Useful tools and workflows that make development easier

### Why a Blog?

As developers, we learn so much every day - from solving tricky bugs to discovering new patterns and approaches. I've always found that writing things down helps me understand them better, and sharing knowledge with the community is something I'm passionate about.

### The Tech Stack

This blog is built with:

- **[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)** - A fast and flexible static site generator
- **[PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)** - A clean, fast, and feature-rich Hugo theme
- **GitHub Pages** - Free, reliable hosting
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated deployment on every push

The entire blog is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/marianfoo), so feel free to check out how it's built!
