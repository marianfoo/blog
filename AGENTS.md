## AI Best Practices for Post Metadata

Write clear metadata that supports sharing, search, and consistent formatting. Keep it short and concrete.

### Must

- `title` with a clear, human friendly headline
- `date` in full timestamp format
- `draft` set to `false` when ready to publish
- `description` with a short summary for previews
- `tags` and `categories` as non empty lists
- `author` with the full name used across posts
- `showToc` set to `false` by default

### Optional

- `cover.image` to set the share and header image
- `cover.alt` for accessible image text
- `images` list for social cards if needed
- `showToc` and `TocOpen` for per post table of contents

### Style

- No em dash
